This program decypt MD5 hash string with brute force attack

To install this programm you have to have "openssl lib".
If you don't have it, you can get it on: "http://www.openssl.org/source/".
Than you can run the Makefile, so you must digit: "make"

Thanks to Midnightmare for helping me to realize this software ;)
